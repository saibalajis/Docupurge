This project, called "Docupurge," is designed to help manage and delete files that are marked as "PURGED" in a database. The application connects to a database, fetches a list of documents that are flagged as "PURGED," and then checks specific file directories (defined in the configuration) for these documents. Depending on the settings, it either logs the found documents or deletes them from the file system. The tool can also search within subfolders of the specified paths. The purpose of this program is to automate the removal of unwanted or obsolete files, with an option to simply report on them without deletion, making it useful for maintaining organized and clean file storage systems. The progress and results are logged for auditing and troubleshooting purposes.
